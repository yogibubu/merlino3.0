# Puckering Path Hamiltonian Package

Merlino note: this is the vendored runtime copy used by Merlino 3.0. See
`README_MERLINO.md` for the GUI/Advanced workflow and environment commands.

This folder contains a small Python workflow for Gaussian scan/path analysis
with optional ring-puckering labels and one-dimensional mass-weighted path
Hamiltonian analysis.

For every one-dimensional production calculation, the Hamiltonian coordinate is
the cumulative mass-weighted Cartesian distance along the optimized path. Scan
labels such as torsional angles, Gaussian GIC values, puckering phases, or
Cremer-Pople quantities are used only to build and label structures.
Non-equally spaced path points are therefore handled by interpolating the
potential as `V(s)` and using reduced mass equal to one. Before each distance
increment is accumulated, consecutive geometries are translated to their centers
of mass and locally Eckart-oriented to remove the rotational component of the
displacement.

## Install Python Dependencies

From this folder:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The script requires Python 3 with `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`.

## Quick Syntax Check

```bash
python3 -m py_compile scripts/mw_path_dvr.py
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py --help
```

## Smoke Test

Run the compact validation script before sharing the folder or after modifying
the code:

```bash
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

The script compiles the Python files, checks the command-line interface, solves
small two-dimensional test grids with geometry-derived, CSV-read, and constant
metrics, runs a one-dimensional nonperiodic tail-extension check, and generates
a short Gaussian input. It writes temporary files under
`${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mw_path_dvr_smoke`.

## Generate an Example Gaussian Input

This command keeps the Cartesian coordinates unchanged and asks Gaussian to move
the puckering phase through functional generalized internal coordinates:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py \
  --xyz examples/xyz/erythrose_alpha_E2_dpcs3.xyz \
  --prepare-gaussian \
  --ring 1,2,3,4,5 \
  --start-pucker-label E2 \
  --phi-start 0 --phi-end 360 --phi-step 10 \
  --gjf-out examples/gaussian_inputs/test_erythrose_alpha_E2_scan.gjf \
  --manifest-out examples/gaussian_inputs/test_erythrose_alpha_E2_scan_manifest.csv \
  --chk-prefix erythrose_alpha_E2_test
```

## Run Gaussian

Example:

```bash
g16 < examples/gaussian_inputs/erythrose_alpha_E2_dpcs3_phi_scan_10deg.gjf > examples/gaussian_outputs/erythrose_alpha_E2_dpcs3_phi_scan_10deg.log
```

## Analyze a Completed Scan

After Gaussian has finished, any optimized Gaussian scan/path log can be
analyzed; the scanned coordinate does not have to be puckering:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py \
  --gaussian-log examples/gaussian_outputs/erythrose_alpha_E2_dpcs3_phi_scan_10deg.log \
  --log-selection last-per-link \
  --boundary periodic \
  --solver fourier \
  --compute-rotconst \
  --label-cremer-pople \
  --outdir examples/gaussian_outputs \
  --figdir examples/figs \
  --prefix erythrose_alpha_E2_dpcs3_phi_scan_10deg
```

`--label-cremer-pople` is optional and should be used with `--ring` only when
ring labels are wanted. If Gaussian printed `QPck....`/`PhiP....` GIC values,
the profile includes raw `gic_*` columns and fitted `CP_from_GIC_*` bridge
columns.

Read `docs/mw_path_dvr_manual.md` for the phase convention, input options, and
troubleshooting notes.

## One-Mode Anharmonic Output

Gaussian VPT2 logs can also be used directly for a one-dimensional variational
comparison along a selected normal mode:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py \
  --gaussian-log examples/gaussian_outputs/alpha_VPT2.log \
  --anharmonic-mode 1 \
  --well-type double \
  --grid 401 \
  --levels 8 \
  --prefix alpha_mode1_vpt2_dvr
```

`--anharmonic-mode` is the ordinary mode number to be treated variationally,
using the standard Gaussian `Frequencies --` ordering. The code maps that mode
to the force-constant table used for F2/F3/F4. Use
`--anharmonic-mode-order force-table` only when you intentionally want to
address the table index directly. For a double well, `Q=0` is the
transition-state reference point; for a single well, `Q=0` is the minimum. The
`auto` derivative model uses the Handy Gauss-like coordinate when F3 is zero,
the Handy Morse-like coordinate for a single asymmetric minimum, and a shifted
inverse-power model when a real TS/double-well fit exists. The Handy
coordinates preserve the local F2/F3/F4 derivatives while improving the
large-displacement behavior of the normal coordinate cut. A degree-8 confining
wall is added by default and does not alter derivatives through fourth order at
`Q=0`. For single-well cases the output also compares the standard one-mode
normal-coordinate VPT2 levels with the variational levels obtained from the
selected Handy-Morse or Handy-Gaussian analytic potential.

## Graphical Interface

The command line remains the reproducible backend, but a small Tkinter GUI is
available for building and running common commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr_gui.py
```

The GUI covers the three main workflows: Gaussian anharmonic one-mode analysis,
one-dimensional path calculations, and rectangular 2D grids. It shows the exact
command before launching it, so runs can still be copied into scripts or notes.

For development work, start from `docs/DEVELOPMENT_STATE.md` and
`docs/ROADMAP.md`. These files describe the implemented algorithms, test
commands, known limitations, and the next planned steps without relying on the
separate tetrose manuscript folder.

## Robust Default Workflow

The conservative production default is to use the sampled mass-weighted
Cartesian path as the potential core, with reduced mass equal to one:

1. Provide enough relaxed structures along the curvilinear path whenever
   possible.
2. Set `--well-type single` or `--well-type double` explicitly for production
   runs.
3. Use `--path-symmetry half-even-origin` only when the first point is the
   symmetry point, and `--path-symmetry half-even-last` only when the last point
   is the symmetry point.
4. Leave `--core-model auto`, which keeps the sampled core except for very
   sparse unsymmetrized double wells.
5. Add nonperiodic tails only when the computed endpoints are not high enough;
   prefer `--potential-extension repulsive-exponential` for a steep repulsive
   wall, and compare degree-8 polynomial tails as a sensitivity check.
6. For periodic paths, symmetry preprocessing is allowed but analytic tails and
   spline smoothing are not.

For nonperiodic paths, use `--solver gaussian` for the optimized distributed
Gaussian basis or `--solver sinc-dvr` as a simple fallback. The Gaussian solver
uses analytic overlap/kinetic matrix elements, Gauss-Hermite quadrature for
potential/property matrices, overlap-subspace pruning, and optional nonlinear
optimization of centers and widths. The manual lists the main method
references.

Scalar properties can be supplied point-by-point in `--properties-csv` or from
local derivatives with `--property-derivatives-csv`. Derivative rows use
`property,value,d1,d2,...` in the mass-scaled path coordinate, so no additional
reduced mass is needed. For symmetrized potentials, `parity=auto` treats an
even-degree property as symmetric and an odd-degree property as antisymmetric;
the latter has the central value as its diagonal expectation at 0 K and at any
Boltzmann temperature requested with `--temperature`.

For half scans or scans with shallow terminal barriers, the nonperiodic 1D
workflow can first symmetrize the path and add analytic repulsive tails before
interpolation. The production pattern used for inversion-type coordinates is:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py \
  --gaussian-log path_scan.log \
  --log-selection all \
  --gaussian-energy post-scf \
  --boundary nonperiodic \
  --solver sinc-dvr \
  --path-symmetry half-even \
  --well-type double \
  --property A_MHz --property B_MHz --property C_MHz \
  --vpt2-property-csv vpt2_1d_properties.csv \
  --potential-extension repulsive-exponential \
  --extension-length-au 50 \
  --extension-target-cm 10000 \
  --extension-points 32 \
  --potential-smoothing spline \
  --plot-max-state 5 \
  --plot-property-smooth-degree 2 \
  --compute-rotconst \
  --prefix path_extended
```

Use `--gaussian-energy post-scf` for MP2 and double-hybrid Gaussian scans. The
default `auto` mode also prefers post-SCF total energies such as `E(method)` or
`EUMP2` when they are present and otherwise falls back to `SCF Done`.
When `A_MHz`, `B_MHz` and `C_MHz` are available from the log or from
`--compute-rotconst`, they can be averaged over the DVR ground state. Gaussian
dipole moments are read when present; by default the invariant
`dipole_debye` is included, while dipole components and other scalar columns are
included only when requested with `--property` (or with `--property all`).
For every selected property the program writes `*_property_comparison.csv` with
the one-dimensional variational average and a one-dimensional perturbative
value. The perturbative value is estimated from a local Taylor fit near the 1D
minimum unless `--vpt2-property-csv` supplies a validated value or delta for that
property. The older `*_vpt2_property_correction.csv` filename is also written
for compatibility and includes the variational-minus-VPT2 correction that can be
added to a total perturbative correction. `--plot-max-state` controls the energy
window of the potential plot; the default is state 5.

Use `--well-type single` for one-well coordinates, where `single-morse` and
`single-inverse-power` analytic continuations are available. Use
`--path-symmetry half-even-last` when the supplied half path ends at the symmetry
point, and `half-even-origin` when it starts at the symmetry point. Symmetry
preprocessing can also be combined with `--boundary periodic`; only analytic
tail extensions remain nonperiodic. For asymmetric double wells, keep `--path-symmetry none` and use
`--core-model asymmetric-parabola-gaussian`, or leave `--core-model auto` for a
sparse scan. For polynomial tails, use degree 8 as a sensitivity check. The
`*_summary.txt` file reports the fitted endpoint derivatives, monotonic/convex
tail diagnostics, and, for symmetric double-minimum paths, the Flanigan-de la Vega
criterion for choosing between parabola+Gaussian and double-Morse central
representations. The criterion is not used to choose endpoint tails. The
`*_model_profile.csv` file records the symmetrized and extended sample points.

## Two-Dimensional Grids

The same script can solve a two-dimensional product-basis Hamiltonian from a
rectangular CSV grid:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py \
  --grid2d-csv examples/gaussian_outputs/phi_q_grid.csv \
  --q1-key phi --q2-key q \
  --energy-key energy_cm-1 --energy-unit cm-1 \
  --boundary1 periodic --boundary2 nonperiodic \
  --solver1 fourier --solver2 gaussian \
  --basis1 16 --basis2 12 \
  --levels 20 \
  --prefix phi_q_2d
```

Each axis can be periodic or nonperiodic. The code first diagonalizes two 1D
reference Hamiltonians, retains the requested number of functions on each axis,
and then solves the full 2D Hamiltonian in the reduced product basis.

The default kinetic metric is constant (`--metric-mode constant`, with `--g11`,
`--g22`, and optional `--g12`). Coordinate-dependent metrics can also be used:
`--metric-mode csv` reads `g11/g12/g22` columns, while `--metric-mode geometry`
computes the pointwise metric automatically from a matching rectangular grid of
Cartesian structures. The geometry route uses mass-weighted Eckart finite
differences and implements the Laane-style Hermitian form
`p_i g_ij(q1,q2) p_j`.

For geometry-derived metrics, the default is robust production mode:
`--metric-stencil 5` uses a wider finite-difference stencil when the grid
allows it, `--metric-smoothing auto` fits a low-order polynomial/Fourier
surface to the metric, and `--metric-eigenvalue-floor` projects any nearly
singular point back to a positive-definite metric. Use `--metric-smoothing none`
to inspect the raw finite-difference metric.

Example with automatic metric construction:

```bash
python3 scripts/mw_path_dvr.py \
  --grid2d-csv examples/gaussian_outputs/phi_q_grid.csv \
  --grid2d-geom-log examples/gaussian_outputs/phi_q_grid.log \
  --grid2d-geom-log-selection last-per-link \
  --q1-key phi --q2-key q \
  --energy-key energy_cm-1 --energy-unit cm-1 \
  --boundary1 periodic --boundary2 nonperiodic \
  --metric-mode geometry \
  --metric-stencil 5 \
  --metric-smoothing auto \
  --basis1 16 --basis2 12 \
  --levels 20 \
  --prefix phi_q_2d_geometry_metric
```

For convergence checks, add for example:

```bash
  --convergence-scan \
  --convergence-basis1 8,12,16 \
  --convergence-basis2 8,12 \
  --convergence-prune-potentials min,mean \
  --convergence-strides 2,1
```

The code also supports energy-window pruning on each 1D axis
(`--prune-energy-window1`, `--prune-energy-window2`) and product-basis pruning
from coefficient weights (`--prune-product-coeff-threshold`).

Planned TODOs are higher-dimensional product bases, Gaussian input generation
for 2D/3D grids, optional Podolsky pseudopotential corrections, and native
six-/seven-membered-ring puckering coordinate builders. Six-membered rings are
one motivation for 2D puckering Hamiltonians, and seven-membered rings motivate
the later 3D version.
