# ORACLE Refactor Plan

Date: 2026-06-26

## Goal

Create a clean ORACLE repository from the current `merlino3.0`/Merlino4
workspace without losing the working scientific code, manuals, regression
fixtures or GUI workflows.

ORACLE means **Operational Recognition of Atomistic Connectivity and Local
Environments**. It should be the suite-level project. Existing Merlino module
names remain compatibility aliases until the package boundaries are stable and
covered by tests.

## Current Situation

The repository already contains useful Merlino4 package boundaries:

- `merlino_core`: configuration, workspace layout, manifests and shared errors.
- `merlino_gic`: GICForge service, frozen GIC schemas and B-matrix evaluation.
- `merlino_semiexp`: MORPHEUS/SEfit single- and multi-structure refinement.
- `merlino_gf`: frozen-GIC GF/PED analysis.
- `merlino_gaussian`: Gaussian adapters.
- `merlino_fortran`: backend discovery and wrappers.
- `merlino_dvr`: DVR workflow wrapper.
- `merlino_vpt2_vci`: QFF, VPT2/VCI and Davidson prototypes.
- `merlino_gui`: newer workflow dashboard.

The same tree also still contains legacy or mixed-responsibility areas:

- `gui` and `advanced` still orchestrate scientific services directly.
- `geometry`, `topology` and `merlino_fit` overlap and create cross-package
  dependencies.
- `working`, `tmp`, generated paper artifacts and LaTeX build files pollute
  the checkout.
- `doc/papers` mixes source manuscripts, generated tables, analysis results and
  build products.
- `puckering_dvr` is a large vendored backend and should be treated as an
  engine, not as ordinary ORACLE application code.

The current worktree is dirty. Before moving files, preserve it as a historical
state and separate code changes from generated outputs.

## Manuals Read

The `newmsr_overleaf` manuals define the target scientific contracts:

- MORPHEUS Manual: single-structure semiexperimental refinement, constraints,
  predicates, parameter classes, GIC and symmetry-Cartesian coordinate models,
  diagnostics and CLI/GUI workflow.
- GICForge Manual: deterministic non-redundant GIC construction, ring and
  butterfly coordinates, symmetry adaptation, SYCART and the Python/Fortran
  identity contract.
- GF/PED Manual: Cartesian Hessian plus frozen GIC definition, Pulay-style
  scaling, Wilson GF/PED reports and CSV outputs.
- Multi-Structure MORPHEUS Manual: shared class-correction refinement across
  related molecules or conformers, priors, hard constraints, synthon `Zeff`
  typing, ensemble diagnostics and paper artifact generation.

These manuals should become ORACLE contract documentation, not side artifacts.

## Proposed ORACLE Repository Layout

Use a monorepo first. Split into multiple repositories only after interfaces,
tests and release boundaries are stable.

## Subproject Responsibilities

`oracle-core`

- Workspace layout: `inputs/`, `runs/`, `outputs/`, `reports/`, `cache`,
  `logs`.
- Run manifests, checksums, config, logging and shared typed errors.
- No chemistry, GUI, Gaussian or Fortran-specific logic.

`oracle-chem`

- Atoms, masses, isotopes, XYZ, inertia, topology, rings, symmetry and primitive
  geometry utilities.
- This should absorb the stable parts of `geometry`, `topology` and topology
  pieces now under `merlino_fit`.

`oracle-gicforge`

- GIC construction, ring numbering, symmetry labels, SYCART, frozen schemas,
  B-matrix evaluation and Python/Fortran comparison.
- Owns the GICForge public service and normalized schema.

`oracle-morpheus`

- Single-structure and multi-structure semiexperimental refinement.
- Consumes frozen coordinate models from `oracle-gicforge` or
  symmetry-Cartesian data.
- Owns constraints, predicates, parameter classes, robust least squares,
  diagnostics, reports and reference-library search.

`oracle-gf`

- Frozen-GIC Hessian transformation, Wilson GF/PED, Pulay scaling, reports and
  CSV tables.
- Must stay independent from VPT2/VCI.

`oracle-gaussian`

- Gaussian input writing, log/FCHK/QFF parsing and normalized correction tables.
- Gaussian is an adapter, not an internal model.

`oracle-engines`

- Discovery, build checks and subprocess wrappers for Fortran and vendored
  engines.
- GUI and scientific packages should call this layer instead of executing
  binaries directly.

`oracle-dvr`

- Scan/grid to DVR workflow, Cremer-Pople labeling and output readers.
- Treat `puckering_dvr` as a vendored engine or adapter backend.

`oracle-vpt2-vci`

- Normal-mode QFF, VPT2/VCI basis management and Davidson diagonalization.
- Consumes normalized force-field data from `oracle-gaussian`.

`oracle-gui`

- PySide6 controllers and views only.
- No scientific algorithms, no direct Fortran calls, no duplicate parsers.

## Pipeline Contract

Every project workflow should follow the same shape:

```text
inputs/
  user-provided geometries, job files, Gaussian logs, observation tables
runs/
  timestamped immutable run directories
outputs/
  canonical machine-readable outputs
reports/
  human-readable text, HTML, LaTeX or PDF summaries
cache/
  reusable derived data
logs/
  application and backend logs
```

Every run writes an `oracle.run.v1` manifest with:

- workflow name and schema version
- input paths and SHA256 hashes
- output paths and SHA256 hashes
- parameters
- backend executable/source metadata
- git commit and dirty flag when available
- status and user-facing messages

During compatibility migration, accept and emit `merlino.run.v1` where needed,
but the new ORACLE manifest should be the forward contract.

## Migration Phases

### Phase 0: Freeze and Inventory

1. Create a clean archive or branch from the current dirty `merlino3.0` state.
2. Split pending changes into groups: code, examples, benchmarks, papers,
   generated artifacts and local runtime outputs.
3. Add missing ignore rules for LaTeX build files and runtime outputs that are
   currently showing up in `git status`.
4. Copy the manuals from `newmsr_overleaf` into `doc/manuals` or confirm that
   the existing `doc/manuals` copy is canonical.

Exit criteria:

- Historical state preserved.
- No generated runtime output mixed with source changes.
- Existing `./freeze_check.sh` behavior documented, even if not yet green.

### Phase 1: ORACLE Skeleton

1. Create the ORACLE monorepo skeleton with workspace-aware `pyproject.toml`.
2. Add package placeholders and compatibility aliases:
   `merlino_core -> oracle_core`, `merlino_gic -> oracle_gicforge`, etc.
3. Move only docs and metadata first; do not move scientific code in the first
   commit.
4. Add an `oracle` CLI that initially delegates to `python -m merlino`.

Exit criteria:

- `oracle --help` works.
- Existing Merlino imports still work.
- No scientific behavior changed.

### Phase 2: Core and Engines

1. Extract `oracle-core` from `merlino_core`.
2. Extract `oracle-engines` from `merlino_fortran` plus backend build checks.
3. Normalize manifest schema to `oracle.run.v1` while preserving
   `merlino.run.v1` readers.
4. Replace direct subprocess calls in services with engine wrappers.

Exit criteria:

- Core tests pass.
- GICForge/DVR/Fortran build discovery tests pass.
- Manifest compatibility test covers both schemas.

### Phase 3: Chemistry Foundation

1. Merge stable `geometry`, `topology` and selected `merlino_fit.topology`
   services into `oracle-chem`.
2. Remove circular dependencies between topology and `merlino_fit`.
3. Define one public molecular model for atoms, coordinates, masses, graph,
   rings and symmetry metadata.

Exit criteria:

- `oracle-gicforge` and `oracle-morpheus` can consume `oracle-chem`.
- No package imports legacy `geometry` or `topology` directly except
  compatibility wrappers.

### Phase 4: GICForge and MORPHEUS

1. Move GICForge services and frozen schema models into `oracle-gicforge`.
2. Move MORPHEUS single-structure and ensemble workflows into
   `oracle-morpheus`.
3. Keep the manuals as contract docs and add examples that match each manual.
4. Add regression fixtures for GICForge, SYCART, single MORPHEUS and ensemble
   MORPHEUS.

Exit criteria:

- `oracle gicforge define`, `oracle morpheus fit` and
  `oracle morpheus ensemble` run without importing GUI modules.
- Existing semiexp tests pass under ORACLE names and Merlino aliases.

### Phase 5: Analysis Engines

1. Move GF/PED into `oracle-gf`.
2. Move Gaussian adapters into `oracle-gaussian`.
3. Move DVR orchestration into `oracle-dvr`.
4. Move VPT2/VCI into `oracle-vpt2-vci`.
5. Keep GF independent from VPT2/VCI and keep Gaussian as an adapter.

Exit criteria:

- `oracle gf`, `oracle gaussian summary`, `oracle dvr`, `oracle vpt2-vci`
  expose non-GUI CLI workflows.
- Each writes an ORACLE manifest and has small fixture tests.

### Phase 6: GUI Rewire

1. Replace legacy `gui` and `advanced` direct logic with calls into
   `oracle-*` services.
2. Keep GUI state, view models and file selection in `oracle-gui`.
3. Remove scientific parsing, fitting and direct Fortran execution from GUI
   classes.

Exit criteria:

- GUI smoke tests pass.
- Service/CLI tests cover the scientific behavior behind each GUI action.

### Phase 7: Cleanup and Release

1. Move old manuscripts and historical files into `docs/archive/merlino3`.
2. Remove duplicated generated artifacts from source control.
3. Keep benchmark inputs and golden outputs, but regenerate reports through
   explicit commands.
4. Publish ORACLE 0.1 as a compatibility release with Merlino aliases.

Exit criteria:

- Clean `git status` after a documented build/test run.
- New clone can run tests without local `working/` state.
- Documentation explains Merlino-to-ORACLE mapping.

## Immediate First Tasks

1. Commit or archive the current dirty state before any moves.
2. Add a repository hygiene patch:
   ignore LaTeX build products, keep generated paper outputs out of ordinary
   status, and untrack runtime-only files after review.
3. Create ORACLE skeleton in a separate directory or branch.
4. Copy `doc/MERLINO4_REFACTOR_PLAN.md`,
   `doc/PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `doc/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md` and the manuals
   into ORACLE docs.
5. Implement only `oracle-core` and compatibility aliases first.
6. Run the smallest validation set before each migration step.

## Risk Register

- Dirty worktree: high risk of losing active scientific edits if cleanup and
  migration are mixed.
- GUI coupling: medium-high risk; GUI imports many scientific packages and must
  be rewired last.
- Topology/GIC coupling: high risk; `merlino_gic` and `merlino_semiexp` still
  depend on `merlino_fit` and legacy topology code.
- Generated paper artifacts: medium risk; useful for publications but noisy for
  source control.
- Fortran/vendored engines: medium risk; treat as stable engines with narrow
  wrappers.
- Rename risk: high if modules are renamed too early. Keep Merlino aliases until
  ORACLE tests are green.

## Validation Matrix

- Core: workspace layout, config, manifest checksum tests.
- Chemistry: XYZ, masses, topology, ring numbering and symmetry tests.
- GICForge: Python/Fortran identity, SYCART, frozen schema and B-matrix tests.
- MORPHEUS: single-structure fit, constraints, predicates, class constraints,
  robust loss, leave-one-out and ensemble tests.
- GF/PED: frozen-GIC FCHK workflow, scaling and CSV export tests.
- Gaussian: input writer, log/FCHK/QFF parser tests.
- DVR: Gaussian log/grid to DVR args, manifest and output reader tests.
- VPT2/VCI: QFF load, basis construction, VPT2, VCI and Davidson tests.
- GUI: smoke tests only after service/CLI tests pass.
